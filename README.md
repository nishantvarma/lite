# lite

## Overview
lite is a lightweight text editor written mostly in Lua â€” it aims to provide
something practical, pretty, *small* and fast, implemented as simply as
possible; easy to modify and extend, or to use without doing either.

## Customization
The editor can be customized by making changes to the
[user module](data/user/init.lua).

## Building
You can build the project yourself on Linux using the `build.sh` script. Note
that the project does not need to be rebuilt if you are only making changes to
the Lua portion of the code.
